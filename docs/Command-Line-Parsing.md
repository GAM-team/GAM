In bash, if an argument contains a `~`, `|`, `>`, or `<`, you must enclose the argument in `"`; e.g., `name "Test|Group"`.

## List quoting rules
Items in a list can be separated by commas or spaces; if an item itself contains a comma, a space or a single quote, special quoting must be used.
Typically, you will enclose the entire list in double quotes and quote each item in the list as detailed below.

- Items, separated by commas, without spaces, commas or single quotes in the items themselves
   * ```"item,item,item"```
- Items, separated by spaces, without spaces, commas or single quotes in the items themselves
   * ```"item item item"```
- Items, separated by commas, with spaces, commas or single quotes in the items themselves
   * ```"'it em','it,em',\"it'em\""```
- Items, separated by spaces, with spaces, commas or single quotes in the items themselves
   * ```"'it em' 'it,em' \"it'em\""```

Typical places where these rules apply are lists of OUs and Contact Groups.

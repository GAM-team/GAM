"""This module provides a common interface for all HTTP requests.

  HttpResponse: Represents the server's response to an HTTP request. Provides
      an interface identical to httplib.HTTPResponse which is the response
      expected from higher level classes which use HttpClient.request.

  GenericHttpClient: Provides an interface (superclass) for an object 
      responsible for making HTTP requests. Subclasses of this object are
      used in AtomService and GDataService to make requests to the server. By
      changing the http_client member object, the AtomService is able to make
      HTTP requests using different logic (for example, when running on 
      Google App Engine, the http_client makes requests using the App Engine
      urlfetch API).

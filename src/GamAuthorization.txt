New authorization model: oauth2service.json, gamscopes.json

GAM requires authorization to perform tasks on your domain; the tasks break down into two categories.
Tasks that manipulate objects in the domain: add a user, update a group, delete a class, share a printer.
Tasks that manipulate objects that belong to users: calendars, drive files, email.

A Service Account manipulates objects in the domain; the Service Account acts on its own behalf to perform the tasks.
A Service Account manipulates objects that belong to users; the Service Account acts on behalf of the user to perform the tasks.

There are three broad steps to set up GAM access.

1) In the Google Developers console, you specify a set of APIs that GAM will be able to use and you define a Service Account;
there is no OAuth Client used. This produces one file: oauth2service.json for the Service Account. This file contains an ID
that is used in the next step.

2) As a domain administrator, logged into your domain Admin Console, you grant the Service Account ID access to the full set of scopes.

3) On your computer you run the command: gam oauth create <EmailAddress>
You select a list of scopes for this admin email address and GAM writes the email address and requested scopes into the file gamscopes.json.
You can generate multiple gamscopes.json files (with different names) authorizing different admins access to a specific set of scopes.
You can verify the results of this step with the command: gam oauth info

Step 5.i is not required.
Step 6.ii is not required.
Step 6.iii, authorize all of the scopes: API scopes - OAuth2 and API scopes - Service Account
Step 7.ii, run the commands:
    gam oauth delete
    gam oauth create <EmailAddress>
Steps 7.iv through 7.vii are not required.

You can run versions of GAM that use the old and new models while you transition from old to new. Install the new version in 
a separate directory and copy oauth2service.json from the old GAM directory to the new GAM directory and then run
this command in the new directory: gam oauth create <EmailAddress>

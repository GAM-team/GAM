**Major:**
Implement configuration file gam.cfg. Documented in GamConfig.txt.

Improve support for languages with accented characters.
The following commands have been extended to allow specification of the character set used in the file.
    gam batch Filename [charset <Charset>]
    gam csv Filename [charset <Charset>] gam ...

<Charset> defaults to ascii, other typical values are: utf-8, utf-16, latin-1.
The character set may be specified in gam.cfg as well.

**Semi-major:**
Reorganize gam so that it is importable on Mac OS/Linux.
This isn't elegant but it's a start.
You can say:
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import os, sys, shlex
    from gam import ProcessGAMCommand
    # Set appropriate values
    os.environ['GAM_CFG_HOME'] = '/Users/admin/GAM'
    GAM_STDOUT = '/tmp/gamstdout.out'
    # Choose how to produce args list
    rc = ProcessGAMCommand(shlex.split('/Users/admin/GAM/gam.py redirect stdout write {0} info user admin'.format(GAM_STDOUT)))
    #rc = ProcessGAMCommand(['/Users/admin/GAM/gam.py',
    #                        'redirect', 'stdout', 'write', GAM_STDOUT,
    #                        'info', 'user', 'admin'])
    print 'GAM returned {0}'.format(rc)
    with open(GAM_STDOUT, 'rU') as f:
        for line in f:
            # Process outout
            print line.strip()


All "Getting ...", "Retrieving ...", "Got ..." messages are now written to stderr.
Most already were but the following commands wrote to stdout:
    gam user xxx show gmailprofile
    gam user xxx deprov
    gam user xxx delete label
    gam user xxx transfer drive
    gam user xxx add drivefile
    gam user xxx update drivefile
    gam user xxx delete drivefile
    gam user xxx get drivefile


**Not so major:**
Use API update rather than patch in update user as patch is problematic.

Use API update rather than patch in update org as patch is problematic.

In gam update user foo@bar.com ... allow clear argument after im, address, organization,
phone, relation, externalid and otheremail so that an array of entries can be cleared.
    gam update user foo@bar.com phone clear

In gam create user and gam update user support website.
    website home_page|blog|profile|work|home|other|ftp|reservations|app_install_page|<String> <Value>
    gam update user foo@bar.com website work www.bar.com
If <String> is specified instead of one of the pre-defined values, it will be marked custom.

In gam create user and gam update user support note:
    note text_plain|text_html file <FileName>
    note text_plain|text_html <String>
    gam update user foo@bar.com note text_plain "Works weekend shift"

Allow gam batch to read lines from stdin by specifying - instead of a file name.
    cat foo.bat | gam batch -

A new argument (delimiter <String>) was added to gam print users.
It is used when the groups argument is specified, String rather than a single space will separate the entries in the groups list.
    gam print users delimiter ',' groups

Implement pull request #93 to be able to mark messages as spam.
    gam user foo@bar.com spam message|messages query <Query> [doit] [max_to_move <Number>]

Implement pull request #91.
    gam user foo@bar.com show filelist ... anyowner ...

oauth2client/tools.py message changed to reflect new way to indicate that you have no browser.

**Problem fixed**
Fixed problem with gam user foo@bar.com show filelist allfields
Traceback (most recent call last):

Implement configuration file gam.cfg. Documented in GamConfig.txt.

Reorganize gam so that it is importable on Mac OS/Linux.
This isn't elegant but it's a start.
You can say:
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import os, sys, shlex
    from gam import ProcessGAMCommand
    # Set appropriate values
    os.environ['GAM_CFG_HOME'] = '/Users/admin/GAM'
    GAM_STDOUT = '/tmp/gamstdout.out'
    # Choose how to produce args list
    rc = ProcessGAMCommand(shlex.split('/Users/admin/GAM/gam.py redirect stdout write {0} info user admin'.format(GAM_STDOUT)))
    #rc = ProcessGAMCommand(['/Users/admin/GAM/gam.py',
    #                        'redirect', 'stdout', 'write', GAM_STDOUT,
    #                        'info', 'user', 'admin'])
    print 'GAM returned {0}'.format(rc)
    with open(GAM_STDOUT, 'rU') as f:
        for line in f:
            # Process outout
            print line.strip()

Improve support for languages with accented characters.
The following commands have been extended to allow specification of the character set used in the file.
    gam batch <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>]
    gam csv <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] gam ...
<Charset> defaults to the value charset in gam.cfg; the default value there is ascii; other typical values are: utf-8, utf-16, latin-1.

Extend gam csv to select rows from a csv file my matching a field value.
    gam csv <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] [matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>] gam ...
<FieldName> does not have a leading ~ and must be a column heading in <FileName>.
For documentation on <PythonRegularExpression> see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html
    gam csv DeptGroups.csv matchfield Department Sales gam print group-members group ~Group
DeptGroups.csv:
Department,Group
Sales,sales-ny@bar.com
Sales,sales-nj@bar.com
Marketing,mktg-ny@bar.com
Marketing,mktg-nj@bar.com

Process a csv file without subprocesses. The syntax is exactly the same as gam csv, but, rather than starting
a subprocess for each line, gam executes the command directly. There is no subprocess creation overhead, cleaner output,
but it will not execute as fast on large csv files as there is no parallelism.
    gam loop <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] [matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>] gam ...

Support user website and note properties.
In gam create user and gam update user add website argument.
    website home_page|blog|profile|work|home|other|ftp|reservations|app_install_page|<String> <Value>
    gam update user foo@bar.com website work www.bar.com
If <String> is specified instead of one of the pre-defined values, it will be marked custom.

In gam create user and gam update user add note argument.
    note text_plain|text_html file <FileName>
    note text_plain|text_html <String>
    gam update user foo@bar.com note text_plain "Works weekend shift"

Allow user properties to be cleared.
In gam update user allow clear argument after im, address, organization,
phone, relation, externalid, otheremail, website, note so that the property can be cleared.
    gam update user foo@bar.com phone clear

Support event notification property in calendars.
In gam <Users> add calendar and gam <Users> update calendar, add notification argument; it may be repeated.
   notification email|sms event_creation|event_change|event_cancellation|event_response|agenda
   gam user foo@bar.com update calendar bar.com_dsoevca1qm34unsejmac3tsbv4@group.calendar.google.com notification email event_creation notification sms event_change

Support user calendar creation/modification/deletion.
    gam <Users> create calendar summary <String> [description <String>] [location <String>] [timezone <String>]
    gam <Users> modify calendar <EmailAddress>|primay [summary <String>] [description <String>] [location <String>] [timezone <String>]
    gam <Users> remove calendar <EmailAddress>
Summary <string> is required when creating a calendar.
Primary refers to the user's primary calendar, it is replaced with the user's email address.

Get information about a specific calendar.
    gam <Users> info calendar <EmailAddress>|primary

Allow gam batch to read lines from stdin by specifying - instead of a file name.
    cat foo.bat | gam batch -

The format argument in gam get drivefile is extended to offer more choices of file types and can be a list.
The possible formats are: csv|html|txt|tsv|jpeg|jpg|png|svg|pdf|rtf|pptx|xlsx|docx|odt|ods|openoffice|ms|microsoft|micro$oft
ms, microsoft and micro$oft are  shorthand for docx,pptx,xlsx
openoffice is shorthand for odt,ods
    gam get drivefile drivefilename XXX format docx,rtf,txt,odt,pdf
This will get file XXX as long as it is in some text document format. If a file is available in multiple formats, the first
available format in the list is chosen.

Two new arguments are defined for gam print mobile to set the amount of data retrieved.
    basic|full

A new argument (delimiter <String>) is defined in gam print users.
It is used when the groups argument is specified, <String> rather than a single space will separate the entries in the groups list.
    gam print users delimiter ',' groups

You can for a GAM version check with the following command.
    gam version check

Implement pull request #93 to be able to mark messages as spam.
    gam <Users> spam message|messages query <Query> [doit] [max_to_move <Number>]
<Number> defaults to max_messages_to_process from gam.cfg.

Implement pull request #91.
    gam <Users> show filelist ... anyowner ...

Command line errors now give a more informative message and are all written to stderr.

All "Getting ...", "Retrieving ...", "Got ..." messages are now written to stderr.
Most already were but the following commands wrote to stdout:
    gam user xxx show gmailprofile
    gam user xxx deprov
    gam user xxx delete label
    gam user xxx transfer drive
    gam user xxx add drivefile
    gam user xxx update drivefile
    gam user xxx delete drivefile
    gam user xxx get drivefile

Use API update rather than patch in gam update user as patch is problematic.

Use API update rather than patch in gam update org as patch is problematic.

oauth2client/tools.py message changed to reflect new way to indicate that you have no browser.

Fixed problem with gam user foo@bar.com show filelist allfields

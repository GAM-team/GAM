```
## Special quoting for course aliases
As course aliases can contain spaces, some care must be used when entering `<CourseAliasList>`, `<CourseID>`, `<CourseIDList>` and `<CourseEntity>`.

Suppose you have a course with the alias `Math Class`. To get information about it you enter the command: `gam info course "d:Math Class"`

The shell strips the `"` leaving a single argument `d:Math Class`; gam correctly processes the argument as it is expecting a single course.

Suppose you enter the command: `gam info courses "d:Math Class"`

The shell strips the `"` leaving a single argument `d:Math Class`; as gam is expecting a list, it splits the argument on space leaving two items and then tries to process `d:Math` and `Class`, not what you want.

You must enter: `gam info courses "'d:Math Class'"`

The shell strips the `"` leaving a single argument `'d:Math Class'`; as gam is expecting a list, it splits the argument on space while honoring the `'` leaving one item `d:Math Class` and correctly processes the item.

For multiple aliases you must enter: `gam info courses "'d:Math Class','d:Science Class'"`

## Special quoting for lists of titles
As student group titles can contain spaces, some care must be used when entering `selevct <StringList>`.

Suppose you want to create a student group `Advanced Students`. `gam create course-studentgroups course <CourseID> title "Advanced Students"`

The shell strips the `"` leaving a single argument `Advanced Math`; gam correctly processes the argument as it is expecting a single title.

Suppose you enter the command: `gam create course-studentgroups course <CourseID> select "Advanced Students"`

The shell strips the `"` leaving a single argument `Advanced Students`; as gam is expecting a list, it splits the argument on space leaving two items and then tries to process `Advanced` and `Students`, not what you want.

You must enter: `gam create course-studentgroups course <CourseID> select "'Advanced Students'"`

The shell strips the `"` leaving a single argument `'Advanced Students'`; as gam is expecting a list, it splits the argument on space while honoring the `'` leaving one item `Advanced Students` and correctly processes the item.

For multiple titles you can enter either of the following:
* `gam create course-studentgroups course <CourseID> select "'Advanced Students','Beginner Students'"`
* `gam create course-studentgroups course <CourseID> title"Advanced Students" title "Beginner Students"`

See: [Lists and Collections](Lists-and-Collections)

## Manage student groups

```
gam create course-studentgroups
        (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])
        ((title <String>)|(select <StringEntity))+
        [csv [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]]
gam update course-studentgroups <CourseID> <StudentGroupID> title <String>
gam delete course-studentgroups <CourseID> <StudentGroupIDEntity>
gam clear course-studentgroups
        (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])
```

When creating student groups, the API does not check for duplicate titles; you can have multiple student grpups
with the same title; they will have unique `<StudentGroupID>s`.

The `update|delete course-studentgroups` commands manage a specific course.

By default, the `create|clear course-studentgroups` commands manage student group information about all courses.

To manage student group information for a specific set of courses, use the following option; it can be repeated to select multiple courses.
* `(course|class <CourseID>)*` - Display courses with the specified `<CourseID>`.

To manage student group information for courses based on their having a particular participant, use the following options. Both options can be specified.
* `teacher <UserItem>` - Display courses with the specified teacher.
* `student <UserItem>` - Display courses with the specified student.

To manage student group information for courses based on their state, use the following option. This option can be combined with the `teacher` and `student` options.
By default, all course states are selected.
* `states <CourseStateList>` - Display courses with any of the specified states.

By default, when a student group is created, you will get output like this:
```
Course: <CourseID>, Course Student Group: <Title>(<StudentGroupId>), Added
```
If you use the `csv` option, you will get output like this:
```
courseId,courseName,studentGroupId,studentGroupTitle
<CourseID>,<CourseName>,<StudentGroupID>,<Title>
```
This gives you a record the the student group IDs.

### Example
```
$ more titles.csv
title
Advanced Students
Middle Students
Beginner Students

$ gam redirect csv ./StudentGroups.csv add coursestudentgroups course <CourseID> select csvfile titles.csv:title csv
Course: <CourseID>, Add 3 Course Student Groups

$ more StudentGroups.csv 
courseId,courseName,studentGroupId,studentGroupTitle
<CourseID>,<CourseName>,796177544247,Advanced Students
<CourseID>,<CourseName>,796177718666,Middle Students
<CourseID>,<CourseName>,796177727901,Beginner Students
```

## Display student groups
```
gam print course-studentgroups [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*]
        (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])
        [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]
```
By default, the `print course-studentgroups` command displays student group information about all courses.

To display student group information for a specific set of courses, use the following option; it can be repeated to select multiple courses.
* `(course|class <CourseID>)*` - Display courses with the specified `<CourseID>`.

To display student group information for courses based on their having a particular participant, use the following options. Both options can be specified.
* `teacher <UserItem>` - Display courses with the specified teacher.
* `student <UserItem>` - Display courses with the specified student.

To display student group information for courses based on their state, use the following option. This option can be combined with the `teacher` and `student` options.
By default, all course states are selected.
* `states <CourseStateList>` - Display courses with any of the specified states.

By default, Gam displays the information as columns of fields; the following option causes the output to be in JSON format,
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

By default, when writing CSV files, Gam uses a quote character of double quote `"`. The quote character is used to enclose columns that contain
the quote character itself, the column delimiter (comma by default) and new-line characters. Any quote characters within the column are doubled.
When using the `formatjson` option, double quotes are used extensively in the data resulting in hard to read/process output.
The `quotechar <Character>` option allows you to choose an alternate quote character, single quote for instance, that makes for readable/processable output.
`quotechar` defaults to `gam.cfg/csv_output_quote_char`. When uploading CSV files to Google, double quote `"` should be used.

## Display student group counts
Display the number of student groups
```
gam print course-studentgroup [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*]
        (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])
        showitemcountonly
```

## Manage student group membership
```
gam create course-studentgroup-members <CourseID> <StudentGroupID> <UserTypeEntity>
gam delete course-studentgroup-members <CourseID> <StudentGroupID> <UserTypeEntity>
gam sync course-studentgroup-members <CourseID> <StudentGroupID> <UserTypeEntity>
gam clear course-studentgroupmembers <CourseID> <StudentGroupID>
```

# Display student group membership
```
gam print course-studentgroup-members [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*]
        (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])
        [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]
```
By default, the `print course-studentgroup-members` command displays student group member information about all courses.

To display student group member information for a specific set of courses, use the following option; it can be repeated to select multiple courses.
* `(course|class <CourseID>)*` - Display courses with the specified `<CourseID>`.

To display student group member information for courses based on their having a particular participant, use the following options. Both options can be specified.
* `teacher <UserItem>` - Display courses with the specified teacher.
* `student <UserItem>` - Display courses with the specified student.

To display student group member information for courses based on their state, use the following option. This option can be combined with the `teacher` and `student` options.

## Display student group membership counts
Display the number of student group members
```
gam print course-studentgroup-members [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*]
        (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])
        showitemcountonly
```
Example
```
$ gam print course-participants teacher asmith states active show students showitemcountonly
Getting all Courses that match query (Teacher: asmith@domain.com, Course State: ACTIVE), may take some time on a large Google Workspace Account...
Got 3 Courses...

Got 30 Students...
Got 43 Students...
Getting Students for Course: 589346784341 (2/3)
Got 22 Students...
Getting Students for Course: 589345535881 (3/3)
Got 23 Students...
88
```
The `Getting` and `Got` messages are written to stderr, the count is writtem to stdout.

To retrieve the count with `showitemcountonly`:
```
Linux/MacOS
count=$(gam print course-participants teacher asmith states active show students showitemcountonly)
Windows PowerShell
count = & gam print course-participants teacher asmith states active show students showitemcountonly
```

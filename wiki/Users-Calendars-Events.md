## Recurrence rules
Recurring events require a rule: `recurrence <RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE and EXDATE line>`
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8.5

This is dense reading; a simpler approach is to define a test event in Google Calendar with
the recurrence rule that you want, then use `gam calendar <EmailAddress> info events eventid <EventId>` to get the recurrence rule and use it in subsequent commands.

```
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY - Daily
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=30 - Daily for 30 days
RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY - Weekly on the same day of the week as the starting day; e.g., every Wednesday
RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=13 - Weekly on the same day of the week as the starting day; e.g., every Wednesday, for 13 weeks
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY - Monthly on the same day of the month as the starting day; e.g., every 15th of the month
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=4TH - Monthly on the fourth instance of the starting day; e.g., every 4th Thursday
```

## Event colors
The event color grid presented in calendar.google.com and `<EventColorIndex>` are related like this:
```
11:tomato 4:flamingo
6:tangerine 5:banana
2:sage 10:basil
7:peacock 9:blueberry
1:lavender 3:grape
8:graphite
```

## Calendar selection
These are the possible values for `<UserCalendarEntity>`.
* `allcalendars` - All calendars in a user's calendar list
* `primary` - The user's primary calendar
* `<EmailAddress>` - The address of a calendar in a user's calendar list
* `<UniqueID>` - The uniqueid of a calendar in a user's calendar list
* `courses <CourseIDList>`- The calendars associated with a list of courses
* `courses_with_teacher <UserItem>` - The calendars associated with courses with `<UserItem>` as a teacher
* `my_courses_as_teacher` - The calendars associated with the User from `<UserTypeEntity>` as a teacher
* `courses_with_student <UserItem>` - The calendars associated with courses with `<UserItem>` as a student
* `my_courses_as_student` - The calendars associated with the User from `<UserTypeEntity>` as a student
* `coursestates <CourseStateList>` - Used with the previous four options to select courses in a particular state; the default is all
* `resource <ResourceID>` - The calendar associated with a resource ID
* `resources <ResourceIDList>` - The calendars associated with a list of resource IDs
* `calendars (<CalendarList> | <FileSelector> | <CSVFileSelector> | <CSVkmdSelector> | <CSVDataSelector>)` - A collection of calendars: [Collections of Items](Collections-of-Items)
* `<CalendarSelectProperty>+` - The calendars in a user's calendar list with the specified properites

## Event selection
These are the possible values for `<EventEntity>`; you either specify event IDs or properties used to select events.
If none of the following options are selected, all events are selected.
* `id|eventid <EventId>` - A single event ID
* `event|events <EventIdList> | <FileSelector> | <CSVFileSelector> | <CSVkmdSelector> | <CSVSubkeySelector> | <CSVDataSelector>)` - A collection of event IDs: [Collections of Items](Collections-of-Items)
* `<EventSelectProperty>* <EventMatchProperty>*` - Properties used to select events

The Google Calendar API processes `<EventSelectProperty>*`; you may specify none or multiple properties.
* `after|starttime|timemin <Time>` - Lower bound (exclusive) for an event's end time to filter by. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.
* `before|endtime|timemax <Time>` - Upper bound (exclusive) for an event's start time to filter by. If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.
* `eventtypes <EventTypeList>` - Select events based on their type.
* `query <QueryCalendar>` - Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties
* `privateextendedproperty <String>` - A required private property; `<String>` must be of the form `propertyName=value`
* `sharedextendedproperty <String>` - A required shared property; `<String>` must be of the form `propertyName=value`
* `showdeletedevents` - Whether to include deleted events (with status equals "cancelled") in the result
* `showhiddeninvitations` - Whether to include hidden invitations in the result
* `singleevents` - Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves
* `updatedmin <Time>` - Lower bound for an event's last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showdeletedevents

GAM processes `<EventMatchProperty>*`; you may specify none or multiple properties.
* `matchfield attendees <EmailAddressEntity>` - All of the attendees in `<EmailAddressEntity>` must be present
* `matchfield attendeesonlydomainlist <DomainNameList>` - All attendee's email addresses must be in a domain in `<DomainNameList>`
  * For example, this lets you look for events with all attendees in your internal domains. You should include `resource.calendar.google.com`
    in `<DomainNameList>` if the events use resources.
* `matchfield attendeesdomainlist <DomainNameList>` - Some attendee's email address must be in a domain in `<DomainNameList>`
  * For example, this lets you look for events with attendees in specific external domains
* `matchfield attendeesnotdomainlist <DomainNameList>` - Some attendee's email address must be in a domain not in `<DomainNameList>`
  * For example, this lets you look for events with attendees not in your internal domains. You should include `resource.calendar.google.com`
    in `<DomainNameList>` if the events use resources.
* `matchfield attendeespattern <RESearchPattern>` - Some attendee's email address must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield attendeesstatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddressEntity>` - All of the attendees in `<EmailAddressEntity>` must be present
and must have the specified values.
    * `<AttendeeAttendance>` - Default is `required`
    * `<AttendanceStatus>` - Default is`needsaction`
* `matchfield creatoremail <RESearchPattern>` - The creator email address must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield creatorname <RESearchPattern>` - The creator name must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield description <RESearchPattern>` - The description (summary) must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield location <RESearchPattern>` - The location must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield organizeremail <RESearchPattern>` - The organizer email address must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield organizername <RESearchPattern>` - The orgainzer name must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield organizerself <Boolean>` - The user must be/not be the organizer of the event
* `matchfield status <RESearchPattern>` - The summary must match `<RESearchPattern>`. The API documented values are:
    * `confirmed`
    * `tentative`
    * `cancelled`
* `matchfield summary <RESearchPattern>` - The summary must match `<RESearchPattern>`
* `matchfield transparency <RESearchPattern>` - The summary must match `<RESearchPattern>`. The API documented values are:
    * `opaque` - Busy. The API does not seem to return this value; use `"(^$)|opaque"` to match no value or `opaque`.
    * `transparent` -  Free/Available
* `matchfield visibility <RESearchPattern>` - The summary must match `<RESearchPattern>`. The API documented values are:
    * `default` - The API does not seem to return this value; use `"(^$)|default"` to match no value or `default`.
    * `public` - The API does not seem to return this value if it is the default; use `"(^$)|public"` to match no value or `public`.
    * `private` - The API does not seem to return this value if it is the default; use `"(^$)|private"` to match no value or `private`.
    * `confidential`

## Add and import calendar events
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> add event <UserCalendarEntity> [id <String>] <EventAttribute>+ [<EventNotificationAttribute>]
        [showdayofweek]
        [csv [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]]
gam <UserTypeEntity> import event <UserCalendarEntity> icaluid <iCalUID> <EventImportAttribute>+
        [showdayofweek]
        [csv [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]]
```
By default, when an event is created|imported, GAM outputs the calendar name and event ID.
* `csv [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]` - Output the event details in CSV format.

You can specify multiple attachments; `<String>` is the title of the attachment and `<URL>` is a sharable link from Google Drive.
You must specify all attachments in each command, you can not incrementally add attachments.

Importing events is similar to adding events; the principal difference
is that you must specify an `iCalUID`. All instances of recurring events will have the same
`iCalUID` but different `EventIDs`. The import command supports two new attributes to set the
event organizer, but the API doesn't seem to honor the values; the organizer is set to
the calendar owner.

gam <UserTypeEntity> update events <UserCalendarEntity> [<EventEntity>] <EventUpdateAttribute>+ [<EventNotificationAttribute>]
        [showdayofweek]
        [csv [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]]
```
If `<EventEntity>` is not specified, all events in `<UserCalendarEntity>` are selected. This is not typically used
unless you're trying to change a basic `<EventAttribute>`, e.g., `color`, on all events.

By default, when an event is updated, GAM outputs the calendar name and event ID.
* `csv [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]` - Output the event details in CSV format.

You can clear/modify existing attributes:
* `clearattachments` - Delete all attachments
* `clearhangoutsmeet` - Clear Hangouts/Meet link
* `clearprivateproperty <PropertyKey>` - Clear private properties
* `clearsharedproperty <PropertyKey>` - Clear shared properties
* `replacedescription <REMatchPattern> <RESubstitution>` - Modify the description

## Add calendar attendees
You can specify attendees in the following ways:
* `attendee <EmailAddress>` - The attendee attendance is required with status `needsaction'
* `optionalattendee <EmailAddress>` - The attendee attendance is optional with status `needsaction'
* `attendeestatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress>` - One attendee
  * If `<AttendeeAttendance>` is not specified, the attendee is required to attend
  * If `<AttendeeStatus>` is not specified, `needsaction` is chosen
* `jsonattendees [charset <Charset>] <String>`
* `jsonattendees file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]`
* `selectattendees [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <UserTypeEntity>` - Multiple attendees
  * If `<AttendeeAttendance>` is not specified, all attendees are required to attend
  * If `<AttendeeStatus>` is not specified, `needsaction` is chosen
* `resource <ResourceID>` - Add a resource attendee to the event

For `<UserTypeEntity>` See: [Collections of Users](Collections-of-Users)

## Update calendar attendees
The default behavior is to allow incremental changes to the attendees list;
the current attendee list is downloaded and the specified changes are applied.

The `replacemode` option causes the current attendee list to be replaced with the specified changes.

You can add attendees in the following ways:
* `attendee <EmailAddress>` - The attendee attendance is required with status `needsaction'
* `optionalattendee <EmailAddress>` - The attendee attendance is optional with status `needsaction'
* `attendeestatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress>` - One attendee
  * If `<AttendeeAttendance>` is not specified, the attendee is required to attend
  * If `<AttendeeStatus>` is not specified, `needsaction` is chosen
* `jsonattendees [charset <Charset>] <String>`
* `jsonattendees file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]`
* `selectattendees [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <UserTypeEntity>` - Multiple attendees
  * If `<AttendeeAttendance>` is not specified, all attendees are required to attend
  * If `<AttendeeStatus>` is not specified, `needsaction` is chosen
* `resource <ResourceID>` - Add a resource attendee to the event

You can remove attendees in the following ways:
* `clearattendees` - Clear all current attendees from the attendee list
* `removeattendee <EmailAddress>` - Remove a single attendee from the attendee list
* `selectremoveattendees <UserTypeEntity>` - Remove a selected collection of attendees from the attendee list
* `clearresources` - Clear all resource attendees from the event
* `removeresource <ResourceID>` - Remove a resource attendee from the event

For `<UserTypeEntity>` See: [Collections of Users](Collections-of-Users)

## Specify calendar attendees with JSON data
You can predefine lists of attendees and use them when creating/updating events. If you set `responseStatus` to `accepted`, no notifications are sent.
```
$ more attendees.json
{"attendees": [{"email": "testuser2@domain.com", "responseStatus": "needsAction", "optional": "True"}, {"email": "testuser3@domain.com", "responseStatus": "accepted"}, {"email": "testuser4@domain.com", "responseStatus": "accepted"}]}
```
You can use output the attendee information for an event in a calendar and use that data when defining other events.
```
$ gam redirect stdout ./attendees.json calendar testuser1@domain.com info event id 0000h8kk7c9o2tonk73hu2zzzz fields attendees formatjson 
$ more attendees.json 
{"calendarId": "testuser1@domain.com", "event": {"attendees": [{"email": "testuser3@domain.com", "responseStatus": "accepted"}, {"email": "testuser4@domain.com", "responseStatus": "accepted"}], "id": "0000h8kk7c9o2tonk73hu2zzzz"}}
```
Use `jsonattendees file ./attendees.json` in `create/update event`.

## Delete selected calendar events
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> delete events <UserCalendarEntity> [<EventEntity>] [doit] [<EventNotificationAttribute>]
gam <UserTypeEntity> purge events <UserCalendarEntity> [<EventEntity>] [doit] [<EventNotificationAttribute>]
```
If `<EventEntity>` is not specified, all events in `<UserCalendarEntity>` are selected. This is not typically used.

No events are deleted unless you specify the `doit` option; omit `doit` to verify that you properly selected the events to delete.

When events are deleted from a calendar, they are moved to the calendar's trash and are only permanently deleted (purged) after 30 days.
Following a suggestion here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41043053/how-to-empty-calendar-trash-via-google-services) you can permanently delete
calendar events with `purge events`. This is achieved by creating a temporary calendar, deleting the events, moving the deleted events to the temporary calendar
and then deleting the temporary calendar. 

## Delete all calendar events
For a user's primary calendar:
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> wipe events primary
```
For non-primary calendars:
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> delete events <UserCalendarEntity> [doit] [<EventNotificationAttribute>]
```
No events are deleted unless you specify the `doit` option; omit `doit` to verify that you properly selected the events to delete.

# Delete all event resources
Use option `clearresources` to clear all resources from a user's future calendar events.
```
gam user user@domain.com update events primary matchfield attendeespattern @resource.calendar.google.com after now clearresources
```

## Empty calendar trash
A user signed in to Google Calendar can empty the calendar trash but there is no direct API support for this operation.
To empty the calendar trash a temporary calendar is created, the deleted events are moved to the temporary calendar and then the temporary calendar is deleted.
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> empty calendartrash <UserCalendarEntity>
```

## Move calendar events to another calendar
Generally you won't move all events from one calendar to another; typically, you'll move events created by the event creator
using `matchfield creatoremail <RESearchPattern>` in conjunction with other `<EventSelectProperty>` and `<EventMatchProperty>` options.
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> move events <UserCalendarEntity> [<EventEntity>] destination|to <CalendarItem> [<EventNotificationAttribute>]
```

## Display calendar events
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> info events <UserCalendarEntity> [<EventEntity>] [maxinstances <Number>]
        [fields <EventFieldNameList>] [showdayofweek]
        [formatjson]
```
In `<EventEntity>`, any `<EventSelectProperty>` options must precede all other options.

* `maxinstances -1` - Default, display base event
* `maxinstances 0` - Display all instances of a recurring event
* `maxinstances N` - Display first N instances of a recurring event

`showdayofweek` displays `dayOfWeek` when event start and end times are displayed.

By default, Gam displays the information as an indented list of keys and values.
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> show events <UserCalendarEntity> [<EventEntity>] <EventDisplayProperty>*
        [fields <EventFieldNameList>] [showdayofweek]
        [countsonly] [formatjson]
```
In `<EventEntity>`, any `<EventSelectProperty>` options must precede all other options.

By default, only the base event of a recurring event is displayed. Use the `<EventSelectProperty>`
option `singleevents` to display all instances of a recurring event.

`<EventDisplayProperty> orderby starttime` is only valid with `<EventSelectProperty> singleevents`.

`showdayofweek` displays `dayOfWeek` when event start and end times are displayed.

By default, Gam displays the information as an indented list of keys and values.
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

By default, Gam displays event details, use `countsonly` to display only the number of events. `formatjson` does not apply in this case.

```
gam <UserTypeEntity> print events <UserCalendarEntity> [<EventEntity>] <EventDisplayProperty>*
         [fields <EventFieldNameList>] [showdayofweek]
         [countsonly] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]] [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*]
```
In `<EventEntity>`, any `<EventSelectProperty>` options must precede all other options.

By default, only the base event of a recurring event is displayed. Use the `<EventSelectProperty>`
option `singleevents` to display all instances of a recurring event.

`<EventDisplayProperty> orderby starttime` is only valid with `<EventSelectProperty> singleevents`.

`showdayofweek` displays columns `start.dayOfWeek` and `end.dayOfWeek` when event start and end times are displayed.

By default, Gam displays the information as columns of fields; the following option causes the output to be in JSON format,
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

By default, Gam displays event details, use `countsonly` to display only the number of events. `formatjson` does not apply in this case.

By default, when writing CSV files, Gam uses a quote character of double quote `"`. The quote character is used to enclose columns that contain
the quote character itself, the column delimiter (comma by default) and new-line characters. Any quote characters within the column are doubled.
When using the `formatjson` option, double quotes are used extensively in the data resulting in hard to read/process output.
The `quotechar <Character>` option allows you to choose an alternate quote character, single quote for instance, that makes for readable/processable output.
`quotechar` defaults to `gam.cfg/csv_output_quote_char`. When uploading CSV files to Google, double quote `"` should be used.

### Special character processing
When outputting events with `formatjson` with the goal of adding the events to another calendar,
use these options at the beginning of the command:
```config csv_output_convert_cr_nl false csv_output_no_escape_char true```

On the subsequent command to add the events, use this option at the beginning of the command:
```config csv_input_no_escape_char true```

These options ensure that newline `\n`, double quote `"`, single quote `'` and backslash `\` are
properly processed.

## Update calendar event attendees
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> update calattendees <UserCalendarEntity> <EventEntity> [anyorganizer]
        [<EventNotificationAttribute>] [splitupdate] [dryrun|doit]
        (csv|csvfile <CSVFileInput>)
        (delete <EmailAddress>)*
        (deleteentity <EmailAddressEntity>)*
        (add <EmailAddress>)*
        (addentity <EmailAddressEntity>)*
        (addstatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress>)*
        (addentitystatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddressEntity>)*
        (replace <EmailAddress> <EmailAddress>)*
        (replacestatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress> <EmailAddress>)*
        (updatestatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress>)*
        (updateentitystatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddressEntity>)*
```
By default, only events in `<EventEntity>` organized by the user are selected.
* `anyorganizer|allevents` - All events in `<EventEntity>` are selected.

* `csv <FileName>` - A CSV file with no header row and two to four columns; the last two columns are optional
    * `<EmailAddress>,add,<AttendeeAttendance>,<AttendeeStatus>` - Add an attendee
    * `<EmailAddress>,delete` - Delete an attendee
    * `<EmailAddress>,<EmailAddress>,<AttendeeAttendance>,<AttendeeStatus>` - Replace the attendee in the first `<EmailAddress>` with the  attendee in the second `<EmailAddress>`
    * `<EmailAddress>,update,<AttendeeAttendance>,<AttendeeStatus>` - Update an attendee
* `gsheet <UserGoogleSheet>` - A Google Sheet with no header row and two columns
    * `<EmailAddress>,add,<AttendeeAttendance>,<AttendeeStatus>` - Add an attendee
    * `<EmailAddress>,delete` - Delete an attendee
    * `<EmailAddress>,<EmailAddress>,<AttendeeAttendance>,<AttendeeStatus>` - Replace the attendee in the first `<EmailAddress>` with the  attendee in the second `<EmailAddress>`
    * `<EmailAddress>,update,<AttendeeAttendance>,<AttendeeStatus>` - Update an attendee
* `delete <EmailAddress>` - Delete an attendee
* `deleteentity <EmailAddressEntity>` - Delete multiple attendees
* `add <EmailAddress>` - Add an attendee
* `addentity <EmailAddressEntity>` - Add multiple attendees
* `addstatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress>` - Add an attendee
* `addentitystatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddressEntity>` - Add multiple attendees

* `replacestatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress> <EmailAddress>` - Replace the attendee in the first `<EmailAddress>` with the  attendee in the second `<EmailAddress>`
* `updatestatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddress>` - Update an attendee
* `updateentitystatus [<AttendeeAttendance>] [<AttendeeStatus>] <EmailAddressEntity>` - Update multiple attendees

For `add`, `addstatus` and `addentitystatus`:
* `<AttendeeAttendance>` - Default is `required`
* `<AttendanceStatus>` - Default is `needsaction`

For `replace`, `replacestatus`, `updatestatus` and `updateentitystatus`:
* `<AttendeeAttendance>` - Default is no change from current value
* `<AttendanceStatus>` - Default is no change from current value

By default, when you try to replace an email alias with its primary email, the Google Calendar API
detects that the underlying user ID is the same and doesn't change the address. The `splitupdate`
option causes GAM to make two updates to the attendee list; the first removes the alias and
the second adds the primary email.

The attendee changes are displayed but not processed unless `doit` is specified.

## Status events

## Focus time events

## Manage focus time events
You can create and delete focus time events; they can not be updated.
To update a focus time event, delete the focus time event and recreate it.

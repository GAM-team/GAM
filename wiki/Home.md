# Introduction
GAM7 is a free, open source command line tool for Google Workspace Administrators to manage domain and user settings quickly and easily.

GAM7 is a rewrite/extension of Jay Lee's Legacy GAM, without his efforts, this version wouldn't exist.

# Requirements
GAM7 requires paid, or Education/Non-profit, editions of Google Workspace. G Suite Legacy Free Edition has limited API support and not all GAM commands work.

To run all commands properly, GAM7 requires three things:
* An API project which identifies your install of GAM7 to Google and keeps track of API quotas.
* Authorization to act as your Google Workspace Administrator in order to perform management functions like add users, modify group settings and membership and pull domain reports.
* A special service account that is authorized to act on behalf of your users in order to modify user-specific settings and data such as Drive files, Calendars and Gmail messages and settings like signatures.

## Set up a Chat Bot
Since GAM 6.04.00, GAM is capable of acting as a Chat Bot and sending messages to Chat Rooms or direct messages to users. You first need to configure your Chat Bot.

* Run the command `gam setup chat`; it will point you to a URL to configure your Chat Bot.
* Enter an App name and Description of your choosing.
* For the Avatar URL you can use `https://dummyimage.com/384x256/4d4d4d/0011ff.png&text=+GAM` or a public URL to an image of your own choosing.
* In Functionality, uncheck both "Receive 1:1 messages" and "Join spaces and group conversations"
* In Connection settings, choose "Cloud Pub/Sub" and enter `projects/<ProjectID>/topics/no-topic` for the topic name. Replace `<ProjectID>` with your GAM project ID. GAM doesn't yet listen to pub/sub so this option is not used.
* In Visibility, uncheck "Make this Chat app available to specific people and groups in  Domain Workspace".
* Click Save.

## Display Rooms and Chats to which your Bot belongs
Display the spaces to which your Chat Bot can send messages.
A space can be a direct message to a user, a chat group or a chat room.
At first you'll have no spaces listed. Try [finding your bot and chatting it](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7655820) and then your space will be listed.

### Display information about a specific chat space
```
gam info chatspace space <ChatSpace>
        [fields <ChatSpaceFieldNameList>]
        [formatjson]
```
By default, Gam displays the information as an indented list of keys and values.
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

### Display information about all chat spaces
```
gam show chatspaces
        [fields <ChatSpaceFieldNameList>]
        [formatjson]
```
By default, Gam displays the information as an indented list of keys and values.
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

```
gam print chatspaces [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*]
        [fields <ChatSpaceFieldNameList>]
        [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]
```
By default, Gam displays the information as columns of fields; the following option causes the output to be in JSON format,
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.
`
By default, when writing CSV files, Gam uses a quote character of double quote `"`. The quote character is used to enclose columns that contain
the quote character itself, the column delimiter (comma by default) and new-line characters. Any quote characters within the column are doubled.
When using the `formatjson` option, double quotes are used extensively in the data resulting in hard to read/process output.
The `quotechar <Character>` option allows you to choose an alternate quote character, single quote for instance, that makes for readable/processable output.
`quotechar` defaults to `gam.cfg/csv_output_quote_char`. When uploading CSV files to Google, double quote `"` should be used.

## Display Members of a Room or Chat
### Display information about a specific chat member
```
gam info chatmember member <ChatMember>
        [fields <ChatMemberFieldNameList>]
        [formatjson]
```
By default, Gam displays the information as an indented list of keys and values.
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

### Display information about all chat members in a chat space
```
gam show chatmembers space <ChatSpace>
        [showinvited [<Boolean>]] [showgroups [<Boolean>]] [filter <String>]
        [fields <ChatMemberFieldNameList>]
        [formatjson]
```
By default, Gam displays the information as an indented list of keys and values.
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

```
gam print chatmembers [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] space <ChatSpace>
        [showinvited [<Boolean>]] [showgroups [<Boolean>]] [filter <String>]
        [fields <ChatMemberFieldNameList>]
        [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]
```

By default, Gam displays the information as columns of fields; the following option causes the output to be in JSON format,
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.

By default, when writing CSV files, Gam uses a quote character of double quote `"`. The quote character is used to enclose columns that contain
the quote character itself, the column delimiter (comma by default) and new-line characters. Any quote characters within the column are doubled.
When using the `formatjson` option, double quotes are used extensively in the data resulting in hard to read/process output.
The `quotechar <Character>` option allows you to choose an alternate quote character, single quote for instance, that makes for readable/processable output.
`quotechar` defaults to `gam.cfg/csv_output_quote_char`. When uploading CSV files to Google, double quote `"` should be used.

By default, only `JOINED` members are displayed; use `showinvited` to also display `INVITED` members.

Use `filter <String>` to filter memberships by a member's role and membertype.
  * To filter by role, set role to ROLE_MEMBER or ROLE_MANAGER.
  * To filter by type, set member.type to HUMAN or BOT.
  * To filter by both role and type, use the AND operator.
  * To filter by either role or type, use the OR operator.

For example, the following queries are valid:
```
role = "ROLE_MANAGER" OR role = "ROLE_MEMBER"
member.type = "HUMAN" AND role = "ROLE_MANAGER"
```
The following queries are invalid:
```
member.type = "HUMAN" AND member.type = "BOT"
role = "ROLE_MANAGER" AND role = "ROLE_MEMBER"
```

## Create a Chat Message
Create a chat message in a space. Messages are limited to 4,096 characters and will be trimmed to that length.

Chat supports [simple formatting](https://developers.google.com/chat/reference/message-formats/basic#using_formatted_text_in_messages) allowing you to bold, underline, italics and strikethrough your text.
```
gam create chatmessage space <ChatSpace>
        <ChatContent>
        [messageId <ChatMessageID>]
        [(thread <ChatThread>)|(threadkey <String>) [replyoption fail|fallbacktonew]]
        [returnidonly]
```
Specify the text of the message: `<ChatContent>`
* `text <String>` - The message is `<String>`
* `textfile <FileName> [charset <Charset>]` - The message is read from a local file
* `gdoc <UserGoogleDoc>` - The message is read from a Google Doc.
* `gcsdoc <StorageBucketObjectName>` - The message is read from a Google Cloud Storage file.

By default, a new message thread is created; use `thread <ChatThread>` or `threadkey <String>` to create the message as a reply to an existing thread.
Use `replyoption` to specify what happens if the specified thread does not exist:
* `fail` - If the thread soes not exiat, a `Not Found` error is generated
* `fallbacktonew` - If the thread does not exist, start a new thread

The first time you reply to a thread you must use `thread <ChatThread>`; if you also specify `threadkey <String>`
then you can use just `threadkey <String>` in subsequent replies.

If you specify `thread` or `threadkey` but not `replyoption`, the default is `fail'.

By default, details about the chat message are displayed.
* `returnidonly` - Display the chat message name only

### Examples
This example creates a new chat message in the given room.
```
gam create chatmessage space spaces/iEMj8AAAAAE text "Hello Chat"
```
This example creates a formatted message and posts it to an existing thread
```
gam create chatmessage space spaces/AAAADi-pvqc thread spaces/AAAADi-pvqc/threads/FMNw-iE9jN4 text "*Bold* _Italics_ ~Strikethrough~"
```
This example reads the MotD.txt file and posts its contents to Chat.
```
gam create chatmessage spaces spaces/AAAADi-pvqc textfile MotD.txt
```
This example reads the Google Doc MotD and posts its contents to Chat.
```
gam create chatmessage spaces spaces/AAAADi-pvqc gdoc announcements@domain.com name "MotD"
```

----

## Update a Chat Message
Updates and rewrites an existing Chat message. Message will show as edited and no notification will be sent to members.
```
gam update chatmessage name <ChatMessage>
        <ChatContent>
```
Specify the source of the message:
* `text <String>` - The message is `<String>`
* `textfile <FileName> [charset <Charset>]` - The message is read from a local file
* `gdoc <UserGoogleDoc>` - The message is read from a Google Doc.
* `gcsdoc <StorageBucketObjectName>` - The message is read from a Google Cloud Storage file.

### Example
This example updates an existing chat message with new text.
```
gam update chatmessage name spaces/AAAADi-pvqc/messages/PKJrx90ooIU.PKJrx90ooIU text "HELLO CHAT?"
```

----

## Delete a Chat Message

```
gam delete chatmessage name <ChatMessage>
```

### Example

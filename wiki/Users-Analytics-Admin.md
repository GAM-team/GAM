## API documentation
* [Analytics Admin API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1/rest)

## Notes
To use these commands you must add 'Analytics API' and 'Analytics Admin API' to your project and update your service account authorization.
```
gam update project
gam user user@domain.com update serviceaccount
```

## Definitions
* [`<UserTypeEntity>`](Collections-of-Users)

## Display Analytic Accounts
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> show analyticaccounts
        [maxresults <Number>] [showdeleted [<Boolean>]]
        [formatjson]
```
By default, deleted accounts are not displayed, use `showdeleted` to display them.

By default, GAM asks the API for 50 accounts per page of results,
* `maxresults` - Maximum number of results per page; range is 1-200; the default is 50.

By default, Gam displays the information as an indented list of keys and values.
* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> print analyticaccounts [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*]
        [maxresults <Number>] [showdeleted [<Boolean>]]
        [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]
```
By default, deleted accounts are not displayed, use `showdeleted` to display them.

By default, GAM asks the API for 50 accounts per page of results,
* `maxresults` - Maximum number of results per page; range is 1-200; the default is 50.

By default, when writing CSV files, Gam uses a quote character of double quote `"`. The quote character is used to enclose columns that contain
the quote character itself, the column delimiter (comma by default) and new-line characters. Any quote characters within the column are doubled.
When using the `formatjson` option, double quotes are used extensively in the data resulting in hard to read/process output.
The `quotechar <Character>` option allows you to choose an alternate quote character, single quote for instance, that makes for readable/processable output.
`quotechar` defaults to `gam.cfg/csv_output_quote_char`. When uploading CSV files to Google, double quote `"` should be used.

## Display Analytic Account Summaries
```
gam <UserTypeEntity> show analyticaccountsummaries
        [maxresults <Number>]
        [formatjson]
```
By default, GAM asks the API for 50 account summaries per page of results,
* `maxresults` - Maximum number of results per page; range is 1-200; the default is 50.

* `formatjson` - Display the fields in JSON format.
